You may find the instructions on slides 77-98 of the HowComputersWork.pptx PowerPoint slides helpful and/or [Binary Numbers and Base Systems as Fast as Possible video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=1&v=LpuPe81bc2w). You should play the game at least until you reach level 4. When you reach level 4, show your instructor. If you have extra time, try to see how far you can get. You can also play another power of 2 game [2048](https://gabrielecirulli.github.io/2048/)
